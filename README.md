# Project Summary

In this project, we'll use a service called Auth0 to do the heavy lifting of auth for us, including allowing for social integrations (github, google, etc).

## Setup

* `Fork` and `clone` this repository.
* `cd` into the project directory.
* Run `yarn`. You know to use yarn instead of npm because there is a `yarn.lock` file.
* Create a Postgres database. Use this project's `db/init.sql` file to create the schema.
* Copy the `env.example` file to a new file called `.env` and paste in the connection string to the postgres database.
  * While you're there, fill out some random value for the SESSION_SECRET value.
  * We'll fill out the other values in the `.env` file later.
* Start the server with `nodemon`.
* Start the web dev server with `npm start`. In your browser, open `http://localhost:3000`.
* Look at the app's code to get a feel for it.

## Step 1

### Summary

In this step, we'll go to `manage.auth0.com` to create an account. We'll create an 'application' that represents this particular app. We'll enable social connections.

### Instructions

* Go to `manage.auth0.com`.
* Register for an account.
  * For a tenant name, choose something professional-ish like your name or company name, e.g. `tylercollier` or `mycompanyname`. This will end up giving you a domain like mycompanyname.auth0.com.
  * Set the account type to `Personal`.
  * Set the role to `Developer`.
  * Set the project to `Just playing around`.
* Log in to your Auth0 account.
* Go to `Applications` using the left navigation bar.
* Click the `Create Application` button in the top right.
  * Pick a name (recommendation: `auth0-mini`)
  * Change the `Application Type` to `Single Page Web Applications`.
  * Click Create.
  * Switch to the application's `Settings` tab.
  * Change the `Allowed Callback URLs` to `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`.
* At the bottom, click `Save Changes`.
* Back at the top of the settings, copy the domain, client ID, and client secret to your project's `.env` file. Be sure to restart your React web dev server to use these values. Nodemon should automatically restart your Node/Express server.
* On the Auth0 website, click on Connections on the left hand side navigation, and then Social.
  * Enable the Github connection.
  * Then click the Github connection to configure it. In the Attributes section, check Email address. Leave the Client ID and Client Secret sections blank, such that you'll be using Auth0's dev keys. Click Save.
  * Enable further social connections as desired.

## Step 2

### Summary

In this step, we'll check if the user is logged in, and we'll forward the user to the hosted Auth0 login page.

### Instructions

* Open the `src/App.js` file.
* Add a `componentDidMount()` prototype method:
  * Make an axios GET request to `/api/user-data`. Use the response data to set the React user state.
    * If the response data does not contain a `user` key, set the React user state to `null`. By setting the state to `null` instead of `undefined`, the displayed user state will show as the word "null" instead of blank.
* Add a `login()` prototype method:
  * Set `window.location` equal to a URL that has the following parts:
    * Scheme: https
    * Host: Your Auth0 domain you set in your `.env` file
    * Path: `/authorize`
    * A query string parameter named `client_id` with a value of the client ID in your `.env` file
    * A query string parameter named `scope` with a value of `openid profile email`, but each space must be replaced with `%20`
    * A query string parameter named `redirect_uri` with a value of `encodeURIComponent(window.location.origin + '/auth/callback')`
    * A query string parameter named `response_type` with a value of `code`.

### Solution

<details>
<summary><code>App.js</code></summary>

```js
class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    axios.get('/api/user-data').then(response => {
      this.setState({ user: response.data.user || null });
    });
  }

  login() {
    const redirectUri = encodeURIComponent(`${window.location.origin}/auth/callback`);
    window.location = `https://${process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN}/authorize?client_id=${process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID}&scope=openid%20profile%20email&redirect_uri=${redirectUri}&response_type=code`
  }
```
</details>

## Step 3

### Summary

In this step, we'll make changes to the project's proxy settings.

### Instructions

* Open the `package.json` file in the project root.
* Change the proxy from proxying all non text/html requests going to the Node/Express server to instead explicitly proxy:
  * `/auth/callback`
  * `/api`

### Solution

<details>
<summary><code>package.json</code></summary>

```json
{
  ...
  "proxy": {
    "/auth/callback": {
      "target": "http://localhost:3040"
    },
    "/api": {
      "target": "http://localhost:3040"
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

## Step 4

### Summary

In this step, we'll handle the authentication on the server side. After the user authenticates on Auth0, the browser is forwarded to your server's "callback" URL. You are given a `code` as a query string value. You need to send it to Auth0 to "exchange it" for an access token, and then send that access token to Auth0 to get user info. Store that user info in the database, unless it's already there.

### Instructions

* Open the `server/index.js` file.
* Navigate to the code for the `/auth/callback` endpoint.
* Make an axios POST request:
  * URL: Your Auth0 domain, with path `/oauth/token`
  * Data:
    * `client_id`: The client ID from your `.env` file
    * `client_secret`: The client secret from your `.env` file
    * `code`: The request's query string's `code` value
    * `grant_type`: hard-code to `authorization_code`
    * `redirect_uri`: `http://${req.headers.host}/auth/callback`
* With the axios response, you now have an access token. Send that token back to Auth0 to get user info:
  * Make an axios GET request. The URL should be your Auth0 domain, with path `/userinfo/`, and query string `access_token` with the appropriate value.
* With the axios response, the data will include a property called `sub`, which is short for `subject`, which is the user's ID inside the Auth0 system. Use that and `db/find_user_by_auth0_id.sql` to look up the user in the database.
    * If a user is found, create a `user` object on the session that is that user object from the database, but only the fields email, profile_name as name, and picture. Send back a response with that user in a property called `user`.
    * If the user is not found, it means they have never logged in before. This is conceptually a "register" situation. Use the `sub`, `email`, `name`, and `picture` field from the response to create a user record. The `db/create_user.sql` file will be helpful for this.
      * After the record has been created, put the user object on the session in a property named `user`, but only the fields email, profile_name as name, and picture. Send back a response with that user in a property called `user`.
* Be sure to put a `.catch()` on the outermost axios request, in case an error occurs.
  * Ensure all inner promises are returned, such that any errors are caught by the outer `.catch()`.

### Solution

<details>
<summary><code>server/index.js</code></summary>

```js
app.get('/auth/callback', (req, res) => {
  axios.post(`https://${process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN}/oauth/token`, {
    client_id: process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret: process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET,
    code: req.query.code,
    grant_type: 'authorization_code',
    redirect_uri: `http://${req.headers.host}/auth/callback`,
  }).then(accessTokenResponse => {
    const accessToken = accessTokenResponse.data.access_token;
    return axios.get(`https://${process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN}/userinfo/?access_token=${accessToken}`).then(userInfoResponse => {
      const userData = userInfoResponse.data;
      return req.app.get('db').find_user_by_auth0_id(userData.sub).then(users => {
        if (users.length) {
          const user = users[0];
          req.session.user = { email: user.email, name: user.profile_name, picture: user.picture };
          res.redirect('/');
        } else {
          const createData = [userData.sub, userData.email, userData.name, userData.picture];
          return req.app.get('db').create_user(createData).then(newUsers => {
            const user = newUsers[0];
            req.session.user = { email: user.email, name: user.profile_name, picture: user.picture };
            res.redirect('/');
          });
        }
      });
    });
  }).catch(error => {
    console.log('error in /auth/callback', error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'An unexpected error occurred on the server.'})
  });
});
```
